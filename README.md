# Diffusion-Augmented Direct Classification (DADC)

Diffusion Augmented Direct Classification (DADC) is a few-shot SAR-ATR method that incorporates a DDPM-based image generator as its few-shot problem solver. 

The code is still undergoing the organizing and clean-up process, in which lots of code snippets written in Jupyter Notebook need to be converted to formal Python files first before they can be released.

We will release the code as soon as possible.
